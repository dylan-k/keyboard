Dylan's Keyboard
===============================================================================

Autohotkey scripts I use along wtih my MF108 mechanical keyboard.

The function row has media keys, mac-style, complete with brightness controls, screenshots and more.

I also have some launchkeys set for fast access to terminal, todo list, notes.
